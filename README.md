## 🚀 Project Overview

Welcome to the Credit Card Fraud Detection project! With the rise of online transactions, detecting fraudulent activities is crucial for protecting financial information and preventing significant monetary losses. This project leverages machine learning to identify fraudulent credit card transactions with high accuracy.

## 🌟 Features

- Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess data for optimal model performance.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gain insights through visualizations and correlation analysis.
- Model Building: Implement state-of-the-art algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- Model Evaluation: Assess models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- Imbalanced Data Handling: Address data imbalance with techniques like oversampling, undersampling, and SMOTE.
- Deployment: Plan strategies to deploy the model in real-world applications.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used comprises transactions made by European credit cardholders in September 2013. It includes 284,807 transactions, with 492 labeled as fraudulent. This highly unbalanced dataset provides a realistic challenge for fraud detection.
